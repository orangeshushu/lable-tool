2020-05-15 16:06:33,"'Weird as hell’: the Covid-19 patients who have symptoms for months. Glad to read that I am not the only one feeling that way. It’s been going for weeks, energy level up and down sometime during the day. It’s a learning curve indeed !  https://t.co/iziJojttK9",0,1,https://twitter.com/RPfertzel/status/1261327114625863682

2020-04-29 06:37:10,"A Q for @NHSuk @NHS111Study .  My partner and I were tested positive for Covid-19. The current advice is to stay isolated for 14 days. We’ve been doing so for 5 wks, so I suppose this advice doesn’t work. How can we be sure that we’re not infectious anymore? Another test ? When?",0,2,https://twitter.com/RPfertzel/status/1255385618806386688
2020-04-26 18:51:27,"After having symptoms for a few weeks now, I’ve just been tested positive for COVID 19. It has been tough, but thankfully I’ve not required hospital treatment and I am on the mend. My thoughts are with those who have been worse and especially with those who have lost loved ones.",0,29,https://twitter.com/RPfertzel/status/1254483247217684484
2020-04-07 15:34:38,"These poor people are patients who have died in hospitals after being tested positive. The actual figure is probably much higher, but with the current statistical tools, impossible to know. We can only guess. That’s really, really grim and scary. May their soul be at peace. https://t.co/iItEY6aJ33",0,4,https://twitter.com/RPfertzel/status/1247548343615729664

2020-04-16 07:43:54,@MarcherLord1 You don’t know how low this venerable elderly man fell at the same age. Sometime one needs to be in touch with one’s emotions to bounce back. Stop being so judgmental. Thanks.,0,1,https://twitter.com/RPfertzel/status/1250691373226954752
