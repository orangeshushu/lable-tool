taste
2020-05-17 07:55:58,@LydiaChiseche Like the way network providers already record our conversations without our consent?

2020-04-27 09:20:58,It's possible for one to be a carrier and yet not show symptoms. Those are known as asymptomatic. The problem with this is that you may infect so many without even knowing it &amp; some of those that you'll infect may also be asymptomatic so the spread will be even greater but......,0,10,https://twitter.com/ManlyBanda/status/1254702065403793408
