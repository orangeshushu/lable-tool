inhaler
2020-04-17 16:12:02,@ALittleLucky9er @LivingSmr @ChrisCuomo No chest X-ray. Fortunately less respiratory symptoms. They did prescribe me a new inhaler which is helpful when and if I’m having issues on that front. Fever is back yet again... day 31. 😣,1,2,https://twitter.com/katemeredithp/status/1251181636424814593
2020-04-16 22:51:57,@AndyDenton Yup! Take your inhaler and continue to quarantine until you’re at least 72 hours symptom free. Unreal.,0,0,https://twitter.com/katemeredithp/status/1250919891546316803
headaches
2020-04-17 16:10:04,"@mdillon421 @ALittleLucky9er @LivingSmr @ChrisCuomo Hi! I haven’t had any chest X-rays. Fortunately, my symptoms are less respiratory based.  I just bought an an Oxygen Saturator and seem good on that front (I’m sure it was worse at the beginning of my sickness). Mostly fevers, GI, headaches and sweats/chills at this point.",0,2,https://twitter.com/katemeredithp/status/1251181141513711623
Tylenol
2020-04-17 05:09:09,@ALittleLucky9er @LivingSmr @ChrisCuomo Have you fevers gone away? I’m only taking Tylenol as needed and my inhaler. Doc doesn’t give much guidance beyond that.,0,1,https://twitter.com/katemeredithp/status/1251014815490945026

no symptoms
