pain
2020-05-27 20:58:47,@MargaretStutts I‚Äôm trying to speak to the vet. The tech who called pushed Benadryl. He has a back disease and is on pain meds &amp; muscle relaxers. They make him really sleepy. I‚Äôm asking for a better solution. I won‚Äôt add another sedative and risk his life even if there‚Äôs allergy relief.,0,1,https://twitter.com/tine__christine/status/1265749314204102656

2020-04-26 16:40:04,@mereburmaster He has a degenerative spine disease called IVDD. It‚Äôs common in dachshunds but any dog can get it. It started last summer. He‚Äôs had a few flare ups.

2020-02-15 20:06:05,"Poor Louie. 
I spent all morning at the vet. He has Intervertebral Disc Disease (IVDD) if you remember. It‚Äôs chronic &amp; flared up. 
Symptoms started yesterday with yelping and shaking. I gave him his pain meds. Today he woke up with swelling.
