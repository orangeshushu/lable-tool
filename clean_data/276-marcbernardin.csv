cold
2020-05-28 00:49:24,"""And I can see now that’s all I ever wanted for you. To be happy. Foolishly, I thought I could be the one to make you happy. So I dragged you down into my world with me. And for that, I am truly, eternally sorry. Hey, do you feel that really cold breeze?” https://t.co/bXx7ccRQd8",3,92,https://twitter.com/marcbernardin/status/1265807350201368576
drug
2020-05-21 18:34:05,"@lindaholmes Yeah. I'm torn. I remember that Ray Charles was a producer on Ray. And he was insistent that they include the philandering and drug use, as the other producers wanted to soft-pedal that stuff. He was adamant it be ugly and not a hagiography.",0,3,https://twitter.com/marcbernardin/status/1263538572205817857
shake

2020-04-02 21:48:43,"@Simms2673 @RhettReese if shake shack were anywhere near me, it'd be in the bracket. And the service nature of the bracket renders one-off restaurants like Apple Pan somewhat invalid...",0,1,https://twitter.com/marcbernardin/status/1245830545642119168
2020-03-22 20:24:00,"(Also, we chose the restaurants in the bracket based on drive-time and delivery radius. So if your fave isn't here—hell, my fave, Shake Shack isn't here—that's why.)",1,64,https://twitter.com/marcbernardin/status/1241822960463171584
2020-01-28 00:42:03,"@thecameroncuffe Like, I think In N Out might be the best burger you can get from a drive-thru—though Wendy's might be a solid challenger—but it's not the best chain hamburger in Los Angeles. Shake Shack, for one, blows it out of the water.",0,13,https://twitter.com/marcbernardin/status/1221956568519888896
taste
2020-04-25 22:58:42,Imagine that: the place that specializes in chicken won a ChickySando taste contest. https://t.co/J5wys1B5tA,2,91,https://twitter.com/marcbernardin/status/1254183081939832832
2020-04-02 23:12:41,"@eruditechick @McDonalds and yet, it'll never taste as good as you remember it tasting. unless you're crazy drunk or it's 2am. (Or both.)",0,1,https://twitter.com/marcbernardin/status/1245851678839988224
2020-03-26 22:36:45,"But the flame-kissed taste of Carl’s Jr pushed it over the edge. The

2020-03-05 06:03:17,"@Massawyrm On that, we disagree. (Of course, I haven't seen it in 35 years. And I had particularly refined taste at 13.)",0,1,https://twitter.com/marcbernardin/status/1235445760742707201
Sneeze
2020-04-20 23:50:08,The Silver Bun ain’t nothing to sneeze at — and I definitely won’t feel slighted if I end up hitting the Five Guys in my hood that’s right next to the In-N-Out (especially if their line is standard too-long). https://t.co/jWNdBdshZY,1,55,https://twitter.com/marcbernardin/status/1252384085957214210

recover
2020-04-13 22:28:21,Then we get a comedy beat—the other Spideys infiltrating Kingpin's gala—to help recover from that intensity. Petey B seeing MJ again. #SpiderBagel,0,26,https://twitter.com/marcbernardin/status/1249826789687345152
