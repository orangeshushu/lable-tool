inhaler
2020-05-28 14:13:17,@pulte I could really use it!! I’m currently using my rescue inhaler daily because my landlord won’t put restrictions on my nieghbor for smoking. I’m so allergic to cigarettes and it was seeping in my apartment for months. I have no money to move to a safe place  $ace7908,0,0,https://twitter.com/glitznglam420/status/1266009655752474624
2020-03-31 22:08:51,I'm using an inhaler now but I'm freaked out about breathing and also not sure whats breathing issues vs anxiety. Worst fear right now is stopping breathing and calling '911' from my cell and them not being able to locate me.

2020-03-06 00:48:43,@Keiran51930642 I know it’s really soon but the ball and box analogy is really the best for understanding grief! The first box shows how you feel right after losing someone and how the ball hits the pain button frequently and it is very intense. The second shows how grief can transform overtime https://t.co/qtvniduOxJ,0,0,https://twitter.com/glitznglam420/status/1235728983901253633
