covid-19
2020-05-28 08:42:44,"Great to be back on @ReadySetTokyo after a much longer than expected break (11+ weeks and I'm almost 100%, thanks for all the well wishes). Tune in for our chat with Olympian @JoBrigdenJones who's working as a paramedic on the Covid-19 frontline - what a legend. https://t.co/2yomrHjvnI",6,25,https://twitter.com/nataliejpeters/status/1265926469106057216
2020-04-17 00:48:54,"My mate ⁦@BevanShields⁩ has been through hell with Covid-19 in London. You must read his account: “I did not think I was going to die but it absolutely felt like the virus was trying hard to kill me. I've never been so sick, or scared.” https://t.co/WS1JauCGOK",22,32,https://twitter.com/nataliejpeters/status/1250949323002482688
migraine
2020-05-14 08:23:28,"@MelissaLDavey You poor thing. They absolutely suck, then you get a days-long migraine hangover to boot. Good luck, I hope it eases quickly.",0,4,https://twitter.com/nataliejpeters/status/1260848188849700865
taste
2020-04-04 02:31:20,@sallyjsara Banana bread with 90% of the suggested ingredients swapped out for things left in my cupboard after 20 days of quarantine. Scared to taste it.,0,6,https://twitter.com/nataliejpeters/status/1246264057541169152
tested positive
2020-04-03 03:37:43,"@MelissaLDavey I worry too. NSW Police checked I was still isolating (given I tested positive) and asked if I had supplies and outside support. It would be reassuring to know Police or the Public Health Unit have checked in on every single confirmed case, as so many would be alone.",0,9,https://twitter.com/nataliejpeters/status/1245918375072522241
2020-03-26 06:47:03,"I’ve tested positive to coronavirus, luckily it’s a mild case. I’m so relieved I chose to isolate when I arrived back in Australia. My thoughts are w those who are sick, out of work, feeling alone, and of course our health workers. Let’s make it @ruokday everyday #RUOKEveryday",75,1154,https://twitter.com/nataliejpeters/status/1243066919193739267
Vitamin C
2020-04-02 08:22:03,"@thomok6 @TheRealBozza The recovery stats suggest it takes a while! My GP’s advice was to sleep and rest as much as possible, eat well (I boosted vitamin c as lack of appetite meant I had been forgetting to eat) and stay hydrated. I was told to take paracetamol - but that’s individual advice of course.",0,3,https://twitter.com/nataliejpeters/status/1245627544046428162
runny nose
2020-04-02 04:25:19,"I’m one of the lucky ones, but a mild to moderate case can still be rough. Chills, fever, sore throat, runny nose, head and body aches, fatigue. Then it got worse in the second week (which seems fairly common) and affected my lungs and stomach. The recovery isn't linear.",4,32,https://twitter.com/nataliejpeters/status/1245567966567002114
