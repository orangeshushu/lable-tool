tired
2020-05-28 21:43:19,@Green_Footballs I'm so tired of his bullshit.  He wasn't being censored.  Ugh.  Primal scream,0,0,https://twitter.com/SageHillfarms/status/1266122907530539008
2020-05-25 16:54:13,@taradublinrocks @BarackObama I'm so tired of him falsely claiming credit for things he actually didn't have any part in,0,5,https://twitter.com/SageHillfarms/status/1264962988907401216
2020-05-24 04:26:08,I'm so tired of not being able to breathe.  Ugh,0,2,https://twitter.com/SageHillfarms/status/1264412341627731969
2020-05-24 02:56:12,@KwikWarren It's infuriating. I'm tired of the press paying more attention to a gaffe by Biden than they do about all the things Trump is doing . They apparently are more interested in entertainment for ratings,0,2,https://twitter.com/SageHillfarms/status/1264389708920115200
2020-05-24 02:52:37,@TimOBrien @gtconway3d Why is he always screaming?  I'm tired of him claiming credit for nothing.  Epic gaslighting  every damn day,0,8,https://twitter.com/SageHillfarms/status/1264388809015406592
2020-05-23 23:57:28,"@realDonaldTrump I'm so tired of your ugliness, name calling  and threats.  This is not how a President should act. You should be ashamed of yourself",0,1,https://twitter.com/SageHillfarms/status/1264344728872632321
2020-05-15 05:27:46,@mehdirhasan @NBCNews Tweet should start with that. Not only don't they say false allegations they state Trumps claims 1st and bury the fact check at the end of the tweet. I'm tired of reporting that's basically stenography repeating trump's lies,0,0,https://twitter.com/SageHillfarms/status/1261166361000251393
2020-05-15 05:17:38,Really tired of insomnia,0,2,https://twitter.com/SageHillfarms/status/1261163809508601856
2020-05-14 21:31:53,Really tired of struggling to breathe. Not sure if it's leftover covid or if it's my tracheal stenosis closing my airway again. Not so easy to find out if it's stenosis without traveling to Cleveland to see my surgeon. Getting an appointment now is difficult,0,4,https://twitter.com/SageHillfarms/status/1261046599167422464
Touch
2020-05-24 23:17:37,@Deb67088601 Don't think it's bad enough to go to ER but I'll definitely get in touch with a Dr tomorrow,0,1,https://twitter.com/SageHillfarms/status/1264697089411428352
breath
2020-05-24 21:55:11,Going to have to see if I can get an in person Dr appointment this week.  I am gasping for breath and it's really not fun.  I wish someone would put me out of my misery at this point.  Ugh,1,17,https://twitter.com/SageHillfarms/status/1264676343838576645

2020-05-14 21:43:50,@byjoelanderson Exactly. I'm still having breathing problems but all my other symptoms are gone. Dr's basically say you just have to ride it out,1,1,https://twitter.com/SageHillfarms/status/1261049606936449026
drug
2020-05-24 03:02:07,@realDonaldTrump @SteveFDA @US_FDA Do you ever stop lying?  Why are you pushing a drug with possibly horrible side effects?  Do you own stock in company or what?,0,0,https://twitter.com/SageHillfarms/status/1264391196589338624
2020-05-22 17:09:27,@orig80saddict The only reason for trump and his buddies pushing this dangerous drug so hard is that they have a stake in it somehow.  No other logical reason,0,2,https://twitter.com/SageHillfarms/status/1263879661085495297
2020-05-15 05:56:18,@IncognitoLloyd @DrGJackBrown Yes! It'll be interesting to see how that turns out. Also some  reporting that a drug we use for parasite control in llamas and alpacas might have some use as well.,0,4,https://twitter.com/SageHillfarms/status/1261173541397037056

shake
2020-05-15 03:00:14,@schmiedesgruebl She was diagnosed about 2 years ago I think. Tremors are her biggest symptom so far.  It's hard to watch her shake,0,0,https://twitter.com/SageHillfarms/status/1261129235101515777
