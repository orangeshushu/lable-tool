antibiotics
2020-05-06 13:16:34,@pigdog666 @danwootton @talkRADIO Keep on at your doctor. A course of antibiotics might help if it’s turning into a chest infection.,0,2,https://twitter.com/lusardiofficial/status/1258022846091190279
2020-04-06 09:55:41,@fchaps68 I’m on the mend.The main thing is that it doesn’t turn in to pneumonia. Try to keep your temperature down with paracetamol and get plenty of fresh air. Sleep with your chest as high as possible. Call 111 for antibiotics if you feel chest pains and you can’t breath properly ❤️,1,19,https://twitter.com/lusardiofficial/status/1247100657393418241
