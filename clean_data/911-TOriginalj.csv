2020-03-26 02:01:30,@AmericanAir  I’m furious that since testing postive for COVID-19 there’s no refund in place for passengers just a credit. I lost my job as well. Why aak for a bailout when your holding passenger’s money hostage. This is called robbery!,0,0,https://twitter.com/TOriginalj/status/1242995060167278592
