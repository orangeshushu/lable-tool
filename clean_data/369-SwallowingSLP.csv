covid-19
2020-05-26 12:26:28,Good morning to everyone but nursing home management who fumbled the ball with COVID-19,0,1,https://twitter.com/SwallowingSLP/status/1265257995732234241
tested positive
2020-04-25 19:47:44,"My coworkers and boss who also tested positive all manifested differently, from asymptomatic to being hospitalized. This is a scary time and as more information comes out we need to be increasingly flexible and SMART.

fever
2020-04-25 19:41:14,That was the worst day. I was out of breath walking 10 feet (resp rate was ~18-27) and couldn’t breathe in the shower. My O2 sat never dropped below 95% (thankfully). I rode out 4 days of fever before I got tested. Gradually my breathing normalized and smell/taste returned.,0,1,https://twitter.com/SwallowingSLP/status/1254133387423514625
2020-04-25 19:39:21,"Went I developed a fever- didn’t have a thermometer but I’m willing to bet ~100 F. The next day I spoke to a NP, explained I work with COVID+ pts at work he said “don’t get tested and ride it out” that day my fever spiked over 100.4 and my resting HR was 135. I cried a lot (2/?)",0,1,https://twitter.com/SwallowingSLP/status/1254132911613399047
