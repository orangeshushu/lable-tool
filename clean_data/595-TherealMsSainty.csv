tested positive
2020-05-24 06:56:46,"@Rose09034882 @SayNoToLabour10 @piersmorgan @BorisJohnson No not every parent! I tested positive and hubby had symptoms. We still had to parent a 6 and 10 year old! Horrendous but we did it! We did it as it was against the rules to let someone else look after them. Why put his parents at risk!?! One rule for us, another one for them!",0,1,https://twitter.com/TherealMsSainty/status/1264450249566965760

We have 2 children age 10 &amp; 6 and we've had to just crack on with it. Some days we couldn't get off the sofa! We haven't got any choice but to continue to parent! Both my parents are shielding!

2020-04-28 10:22:32,"@MorecambeBayCCG Just wondering where I stand. I tested positive to COVID just under 4 weeks ago. I'm still having issues, 1 day I feel great, the next I'm back to breathlessness and tight chest. I'm having episodes of tachycardia at rest. I'm concerned and scared.
