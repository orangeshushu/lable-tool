pain
2020-05-28 13:25:55,"@preshitorian @felicitycallard @PaulGarnerWoof @DominicMoss13 @angie_roo2 @LaurieStras @eiiifla @ClaireHastie1 Thank you for posting this, it helps to know that my Covid experience isn’t that unusual. Week 8: main issues are still breathlessness, chest pain and sheer exhaustion. I was admitted to hospital last week for suspected pulmonary embolism (thankfully -ve). Nobody has any answers!",1,4,https://twitter.com/jac_cully/status/1265997734651314177
recover
2020-05-25 16:17:27,@stumpo_ Personally I’m impressed with the ability for both of them to fully recover from being so “incredibly ill” in just a matter of hours. And just how did they get their 4 year old tested when under 5s haven’t been generally tested?,0,0,https://twitter.com/jac_cully/status/1264953739976343555
2020-05-25 15:55:36,He must be super human to recover so quickly from being “incredibly ill”. I was too ill to accompany my son to hospital in an ambulance but drove the next day to pick them up? Covid affected my eyesight but I could drive 30 miles to see if it was safe? #bullshit #dominiccummings,0,3,https://twitter.com/jac_cully/status/1264948238798458880
cough
2020-05-22 15:26:34,"@sapnid Early days - horrendous sore throat and vice like headache, cough and fluctuating temp. Then a really tight chest followed by feeling as though I’d been hit by a bus and then constant breathlessness and a feeling of a weight on my chest.",0,1,https://twitter.com/jac_cully/status/1263853767520399360
2020-04-15 18:35:50,"@DrDooleyMD My first symptom was dizziness, as though my blood pressure quickly dropped. I’ve had other symptoms too (headache, sore throat, fever, cough and some difficulties breathing) but the overriding issue for me has been full-on vertigo - I can’t move my head.",0,0,https://twitter.com/jac_cully/status/1250493048557047809

Blood clots
2020-05-22 13:58:46,@BeccaSews This is 100% how I feel. I’m 7 weeks into this and was admitted to hospital yesterday with a respiratory set back and possible blood clots. Thankfully home now but it was frightening. I’m a relatively fit and active 44 yo and I can barely walk the dog now. Will I ever get well?,0,2,https://twitter.com/jac_cully/status/1263831672958660608
