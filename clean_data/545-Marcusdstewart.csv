exhausted
2020-05-10 11:36:33,"@MSR_Future @John2017abc I expect Sweden will be better equiped than almost anywhere else when it comes to that. Most countries may have exhausted their citizens patience and their economic recources by then. 

Looks like @WHO are realising that too.

tested positive
2020-05-07 18:44:35,"@TramorePix @johnhhaskell @JesseJenkins There's a few cases where Covid tested positive a second time. Most of these are suspected to be the one infection that took a long time to clear.
Obviously there are anamolies but generally accepted that the body does produce enough antibodies to develop some level of immunity",0,0,https://twitter.com/Marcusdstewart/status/1258467782003482627
2020-03-23 22:27:02,@TramorePix @mattstratford You know UK doctors after being tested positive are being told to go back to work after only 7 days. And they're not tested before going back. So they're potentially sending infected doctors back to work. I think Ireland in comparison are doing ok.,0,0,https://twitter.com/Marcusdstewart/status/1242216312589475842
fatigue
2020-05-07 17:37:29,@TramorePix @johnhhaskell @JesseJenkins I had the virus seven weeks ago. It's no picnic I can tell you. The post viral fatigue is generally unreported and I'm far from over it still. However there is immunity and I'm also convinced Sweden are doing the right thing. And the numbers support that.,0,0,https://twitter.com/Marcusdstewart/status/1258450898189156352

2020-05-07 06:44:26,@IrishTimes Wow! This will solve it! @RichardbrutonTD as you probably know by now we need to change and increase the packaging levy in line with the polluter pays principal.

2020-03-21 19:02:01,@impermanen_ @stewartbrand Of course. I'm just pointing out you've come to the wrong conclusions from your analysis of the data.
