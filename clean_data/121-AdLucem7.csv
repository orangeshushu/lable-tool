2020-05-17 14:06:47,"@CatholicAmina This is why I appreciate Carmelite spirituality so much. Suffering is pure prayer. It conforms us most to Christ. It's the greatest opportunity for Agape. Accepting pure pain &amp; offering full love in return üôè

2020-05-06 20:57:52,@Omar53223122 @enchanteeq @SivanIllingwor1 Christian identity can often be nationalized without itself being Christian. Orthodox countries are very prone to this because their churches can be very nationalized &amp; tied to the state.
