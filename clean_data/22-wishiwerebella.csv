I hope someone is looking out for these patients.",0,3,https://twitter.com/wishiwerebella/status/1246519686407155713
2020-04-04 19:25:55,"This is utter BULLSHIT! In all my Lupus support groups we’ve asked each other and have had several people on Plaquenil tell us they have gotten Covid and not to trust it helps. Just because you aren’t “aware” they exist doesn’t mean they don’t! That’s dangerous non-science!

It’s the exact same med just a different needle. And pharmacy says they cancelled the old order so I can’t get one of those to not miss.,0,0,https://twitter.com/wishiwerebella/status/1221995345086832640

migraine
2020-05-07 04:21:13,Day 51: apparently I’m a masochist because at the 1st sign my migraine was gone I went out again for a last grocery shopping trip for awhile and to see the house.

migraines
