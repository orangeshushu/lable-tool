2020-05-04 17:48:34,@drscott_atlanta Its perplexing that the POTUS has recently gone radio silent on hydroxchloriquine the past few weeks. The results are positive when treated early. Hmmm.. Is Fauci calling the shots now with his promoting the more expensive IV only drug from Gilead? Something smells fishy here,0,0,https://twitter.com/GeorgeJ28772176/status/1257366525037752322
