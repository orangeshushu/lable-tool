tested positive
2020-04-17 02:09:47,@deray This was my only symptom as well (along with a mild sore throat) and I also tested positive. I'm beyond thankful I was able to get tested and never got sicker. I hope you have a speedy recovery as well.,0,0,https://twitter.com/Amelia_Salter/status/1250969676567531528
2020-04-04 20:00:57,"Since then, I have known two other people ages 52 and 75 yo who had this as their only symptom and also tested positive. They are married and I had no contact with either of them. I do think it’s interesting that we are all in different age brackets and all had same outcome.",0,1,https://twitter.com/Amelia_Salter/status/1246528203734355968

smell

test positive
2020-04-04 10:28:57,@Jasmine30088972 @angiedock @PatsyCx @PaulBrandITV I found out earlier today that I did test positive for COVID. So did two other people I know who are 55 and 75 yo (I was never in contact with them). All of us the same- this was our only symptom and we're doing fine now. Please stay safe and if you lose taste/smell- QUARANTINE!,0,2,https://twitter.com/Amelia_Salter/status/1246384252691890181

2020-04-02 01:00:35,@Jasmine30088972 @angiedock @PatsyCx @PaulBrandITV Absolutely and happy to share once I have them! Ppl were surprised my doctor decided to test me b/c my symptoms were so mild. I felt somewhat guilty but she said it's important to understand the symptoms and asymptomatic ppl can do a lot more damage transfer-wise.,0,2,https://twitter.com/Amelia_Salter/status/1245516443581644801
