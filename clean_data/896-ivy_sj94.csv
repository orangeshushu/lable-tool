2020-04-07 08:54:54,@JeffreeStar And when I recieved the call that my moms heart stopped and that there was nothing more that they could do for her. I couldn't breath. My heart was in the pit of my stomach and because I also tested positive I was alone. No one to hug. Making the call to my brothers was so hard.,0,0,https://twitter.com/ivy_sj94/status/1247447750783815680
