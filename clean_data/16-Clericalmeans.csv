fatigue
2020-05-27 16:15:25,"@osutein Day 65 for me. When I rang for help at day 8, begging to be knocked out from rigors, fever, diarrhoea, gasping for breath, hr of 200...i was told there’s no help because I could talk on the phone. Since then, tremor, myalgia, SOB, chest pain, fatigue for two months. Mild!",0,2,https://twitter.com/Clericalmeans/status/1265678004044410881

How many more months before those suffering at home are finally noticed and supported by the NHS?",0,2,https://twitter.com/Clericalmeans/status/1263594336274378758
