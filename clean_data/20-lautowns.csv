breath
2020-05-10 23:15:35,"@kathryn42 Iâ€™m glad to see this thread with you and others feeling the same. My first symptom started over 9 weeks ago, though I still donâ€™t know if I had it. Iâ€™ve left the house 4 times in 6 weeks. I think Iâ€™m okay, then I lose my breath running up the stairs. Itâ€™s really done some damage.",1,2,https://twitter.com/lautowns/status/1259623147718017029

asthma
2020-03-20 10:11:42,"@samanthamaria My asthma has been mild and controlled for years. Iâ€™m now on my 14th day with a wet cough, this week Iâ€™ve had chest pain and breathlessness so severe I was on standby to go to A&amp;E. Key advice Iâ€™ve had is follow gov advice on isolating and start taking preventer inhaler now.",0,0,https://twitter.com/lautowns/status/1240944094341406720
2020-03-16 12:04:03,"@zogman64 Wow, Iâ€™ve never even heard of this! I probably wouldnâ€™t be considered high enough risk to have this as I thought my asthma had improved in recent years. Might be something I look into if that actually isnâ€™t the case! Thank you. Hope youâ€™re holding up okay at the minute",0,0,https://twitter.com/lautowns/status/1239522817969917952
2020-03-15 20:48:53,@monkeyboy4334 @MouseReilly @Gloria_NEme I'd have them test all symptomatic people. I also had severe asthma as a child. This weekend I've had to fight for antibiotics to treat what I hope is only a chest infection.

2020-03-16 13:04:45,"@mulronie Usually, yes. They were still my first point of call this time but seems like GPs currently wonâ€™t see anyone with a cough, no matter the type of cough and/or medical history or other symptoms. My surgery couldnâ€™t even offer a phone consultation so was advised to ring 111.",0,0,https://twitter.com/lautowns/status/1239538090902986753
