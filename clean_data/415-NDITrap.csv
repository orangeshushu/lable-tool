my nose
2020-05-25 00:02:15,@DriveSlow_Homie Facts man lol I seen your comment in that thread from the UK girl. My smell isnâ€™t back 100% either. I would say maybe 50% fr. Canâ€™t smell anything unless I bring it really close to my nose. Even then I barely smell it sometimes,0,0,https://twitter.com/NDITrap/status/1264708320356634636
