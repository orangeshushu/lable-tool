prone
2020-05-20 15:40:05,"@TheAlphaDoug But I get your point - people may be *more* prone to make reservations in this climate. Still, using reservations as a proxy for total traffic (which is what many people are doing) seems like a stretch to me",0,0,https://twitter.com/UpsetPatterns/status/1263132396800675841
2020-05-20 15:38:51,@curtis_gl @paulkrugman So does this mean the data will be biased one way or the other when trying to make an inference about total dining out traffic? I still think holding reservations as a pure proxy for restaurant traffic (as many people seem to be using it) is prone to be very misleading,0,0,https://twitter.com/UpsetPatterns/status/1263132083683237888

1) Q: Can a new (nonhuman) enemy unite us against a common enemy just like during the Cold War? A: No

shake
2020-03-06 12:47:21,@GwailoMD @MatthewDownhour @adamgurri I can come up with practical reasons! Just not ones that are consistent with his framework. Also: 1) my homestate of Illinois elected a GOP gov recently b/c the Dem machine is so corrupt that people probably wanted to shake things up. Dunno if this applies to New England states.,0,0,https://twitter.com/UpsetPatterns/status/1235909834425458688
fever
2020-03-04 13:09:58,"Further, our psychology is set up to be aggravated much more by what we're against than what we stand for. So negativity dominates/motivates, and thus our loathing for the other side reaches a fever pitch.",0,0,https://twitter.com/UpsetPatterns/status/1235190752164147200
