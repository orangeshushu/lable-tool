painful
2020-04-25 14:33:36,Finally seem to be staying fit and getting back to tigger like proportions - also have finally managed to book an antibodies test at my local gp for Thursday. I’m hoping it’s not as painful as that swab they put into my very brain when I was first tested!,2,56,https://twitter.com/Dhodgem/status/1254055967983099910
nose
2020-04-13 20:08:12,4. Every man for himself as usual. Also no joy re testing for antibodies - my doctor says it’s on it’s way but not here yet. And the Initial nose swab test is only 70 per cent accurate and often won’t show until ur 3 days in. so I’m still waiting for my Tony hancock moment.,0,24,https://twitter.com/Dhodgem/status/1249791515976765448

2020-03-19 20:02:15,It seems like 60 per cent of the pop may get it so maybe it’s something a lot of us will go through. The test was in New York and I was eligible because of visiting Italy. It’s a quick swab up the nose and the results came 3 days later.,2,26,https://twitter.com/Dhodgem/status/1240730322481876994
