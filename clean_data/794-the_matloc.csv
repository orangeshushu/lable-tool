respiratory symptoms
2020-04-28 03:19:08,"@TrashGang_ However, for my wife it was a little sneaky. She thought she was healed and in the clear (I had a fever, she didn't - but she had worse respiratory symptoms) and felt good for 3 or so days. Then, she couldn't breathe at all one night, was in the hospital shortly thereafter (2/2).",0,0,https://twitter.com/the_matloc/status/1254973396024201217
chill

Rest up now, there's all the time in the world to #getshitdone once you're officially a momma. There's no failure in #selfcare-only winning (double winning when pregnant). Keep being awesome.",0,1,https://twitter.com/the_matloc/status/1248257022723850240
tested positive

They sent her home, even with a low pulse-ox, because they were out of beds and she was *just* higher than the level they needed to admit her.",0,6,https://twitter.com/the_matloc/status/1247332330752049152
