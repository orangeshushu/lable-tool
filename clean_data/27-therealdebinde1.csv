covid-19
2020-05-12 12:11:06,The problem now is that with COViD-19 nurses can’t just work here or there.   Hospitals &amp; long term care will not allow it which is a good thing to mitigate spread of 19.   But the problem is this went on for so long &amp; now with COVID-19 they have picked one place to work.,0,0,https://twitter.com/therealdebinde1/status/1260180699174383616
