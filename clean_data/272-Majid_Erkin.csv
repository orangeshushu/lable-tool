tired
2020-04-30 22:03:07,Tired of seeing these tweets being liked on my timeline. The designated corona unit in my hospital is already 60% full. And a third of that population are on ventilators. The medical staff is not protected due to the lack of PPE. &amp; this is ALL DURING QUARANTINE. https://t.co/m1eOsAGlir,5,25,https://twitter.com/Majid_Erkin/status/1255981031477383174
