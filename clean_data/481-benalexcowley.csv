cold

recover
2020-04-18 09:07:53,"Useful article if you have Covid 19. Many sources report 7 days to recover but I have yet to find anyone, myself included that didn‚Äôt take around 14 days to begin to feel themselves again. Having experienced it myself this felt like an accurate read. https://t.co/wQqxYRWIc0",0,1,https://twitter.com/benalexcowley/status/1251437281652740099

I never had the cough or temperature but fatigue, general weakness &amp; no smell have been ongoing throughout. Take care x",0,0,https://twitter.com/benalexcowley/status/1250842002469588995
