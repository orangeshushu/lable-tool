tested positive
2020-03-22 14:39:57,"@kunal_khanna @NHS @MattHancock @BorisJohnson It’s nuts that people can’t get a test and scary that some people can carry Covid without symptoms.  I wasn’t in England when I got tested, I was away on location, I was lucky to get a test because of my employer (only because I was exposed to someone who tested positive).",6,45,https://twitter.com/idriselba/status/1241736375889563654
2020-03-17 20:20:17,"@AngelaCPMills It’s a good question, I don’t think this answer has anything to do with fame.  I was exposed to someone who tested positive.  I am hoping that people will get access to testing as soon as possible, until then stay confined.",13,236,https://twitter.com/idriselba/status/1240010084752584704
