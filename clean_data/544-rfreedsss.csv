2020-04-01 16:57:08,Ok. After SEVEN DAYS! AN ENTIRE WEEK OF WAITING! I am officially COVID-19 positive and finally have an idea of when I can leave isolation.

My 14-day self-quarantine was supposed to end today, I've now been isolated for 6. Results change everything.",0,10,https://twitter.com/rfreedsss/status/1245033543295631360
