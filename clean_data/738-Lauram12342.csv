recover
2020-05-28 16:42:13,"@CivilityIsDead @Adriannaa1023 @PoolPlayer902 @TomiLahren They have insurance and will recover in a few weeks.

I’m not sure how many more ways I can phrase that Black bodies being brutalized by Police is infinitely more important than material goods. 

If you can’t grasp that,
I don’t know what else to say.",0,0,https://twitter.com/Lauram12342/status/1266047132391399424

2020-05-28 15:42:13,"@Adriannaa1023 @CivilityIsDead @PoolPlayer902 @TomiLahren Well said. I’m tired of people getting flabbergasted by threats to capitalism (e.g broken windows and stolen TV’s) but refuse to understand the decades of built up anger + oppression inflicted upon the Black community. The sentiment is dehumanizing, as if TV’s are more important.",1,3,https://twitter.com/Lauram12342/status/1266032035862372357

You could compare that there’s more cancer patients per year, but most people will rationally understand that this problem has nothing to do with a novel pandemic.",0,1,https://twitter.com/Lauram12342/status/1250114854456897544

2020-03-24 23:31:57,"@Rabiddogg @Ronsworth @TomiLahren The spread at Rikers is literally because of a guard who tested positive. And you can’t fire someone (an employee) for being sick, it’s literally illegal. Not overcrowding the jails and releasing low-level offenders is the only logical step to avoid a healthcare catastrophe.",0,1,https://twitter.com/Lauram12342/status/1242595036363194369

We need rapid testing available before ppl go back to work. Rapid testing will allow us to isolate those who are healthy vs. those who are sick or carriers.",0,0,https://twitter.com/Lauram12342/status/1249320068447719424
