fever
2020-03-30 01:15:49,"The last day of symptoms, the fever was gone, but I had a terrible, terrible migraine. One of the worst I've had. My neck hurt, and the back of my head was throbbing. I was also coughing and nauseous, and I vomited most of the soup I'd eaten. A cold shower and sleep helped.",0,2,https://twitter.com/jiya_pandya/status/1244433113746456577
2020-03-30 01:13:40,"After around two and a half days of those symptoms (which were the most intense period), the fever started going down, although I still felt exhausted. The coughing fits stopped.

Tylenol
2020-03-30 01:11:40,"At this stage, water, soup, and Tylenol (acetaminophen - as recommended by the doctor) helped, in that it made the coughing stop and helped me sleep. Also lukewarm showers and baths were helpful with the body-temperature discomfort I was feeling.",0,2,https://twitter.com/jiya_pandya/status/1244432071348621312
2020-03-30 01:06:08,"Two days after the tiredness set in, my throat started feeling scratchy. My temperature started going up (still not a fever, but I definitely was feeling flashes of being either too hot or too cold).
