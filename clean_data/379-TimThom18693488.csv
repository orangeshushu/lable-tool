drug
2020-04-12 23:57:02,@chieftb @MichaelCoudrey So the issue is we are recommending a drug before we test? I hear ya. Desperate times require making an educated guess with a drug with know side effects. Interesting how this logic doesn’t support the claims of climate change. All evidence of climate change would be anecdotal.,0,0,https://twitter.com/TimThom18693488/status/1249486719084376070
2020-04-05 21:52:15,@chieftb @MichaelCoudrey But we should do everything we can to beat this. This drug combo seems like a really good option to a lot of really smart people. It worked for me. Don’t disregard a possible solution because you don’t like the president.,2,6,https://twitter.com/TimThom18693488/status/1246918598150344705

Hydroxychloroquine
2020-04-06 01:44:51,@EasyBakedOven @tj_paperstack I was diagnosed with pneumonia due to covid 19 7 days ago. I was given Hydroxychloroquine and a z-pac. Huge difference in ability to sleep in 24 hours. Significant increased energy due to normal lung functions in 3 days.
