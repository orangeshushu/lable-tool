tested positive
2020-04-21 13:30:22,@GovRonDeSantis @foxandfriends Hi I tested positive and was hospitalized. I’m out now but there’s not enough tests for me to be re-tested or for my roommates to know if they got it or if we did a good job of quarantining. Is your plan to flatten the curve by just not testing people?,29,228,https://twitter.com/DikembeDudes/status/1252590501032755201
freeze
2020-04-21 13:13:50,"Hey @GovRonDeSantis and @realDonaldTrump put me on your task forces, someone who’s actually had the virus. Here’s my plan: 
*Test everyone
*Rent/mortgage/utility freeze 
*$2,000 UBI to keep people home til this is over
*Actually close non-essential business
*Medicare for all",7,60,https://twitter.com/DikembeDudes/status/1252586343378702337
2020-03-18 13:41:32,"@SenSchumer Here’s what we’re proposing:

Medicare for all NOW.
Universal Basic Income NOW.
Paid sick leave NOW.
Cancel all student loans NOW.
Minimum 1 month freeze on housing payments.

We need serious bold solutions not half measures and “low interest” loans. People are dying, asshole",0,16,https://twitter.com/DikembeDudes/status/1240272126831202305

2020-04-20 15:45:49,"I don’t have insurance, my bill was $16,000. hospital has been lowering it, now at $9,500. 

They can not test me again to see if I truly recovered because even now we STILL do not have enough tests. How can we open back up if we can’t even accurately test people?",35,268,https://twitter.com/DikembeDudes/status/1252262202205188097
