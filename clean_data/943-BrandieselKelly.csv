fever
2020-05-15 09:41:09,"@albyva @MaraGay @MCaruso_Cabrera I've have this virus for 63 days. 63. I can't breath, had seizure like symptoms which now turned into migraines, a fever for 3 weeks, sleeping for 15 hours at a time and 5 ER visits with 2 admits. You should take this a little more seriously.",1,11,https://twitter.com/BrandieselKelly/status/1261230127079448580

Only had a fever for 7 days but it finally broke. It will get better. Hang in there, girl! We'll push through this together!!",0,1,https://twitter.com/BrandieselKelly/status/1257547069700681728

Here's my photo. I have been in touch with another recovering person as well. Jen Ellison Cooper. We are friends in Facebook now and have been similar symptoms. She told me her doc asked her to try Pepcid for the breathing. I tried it and am breathing much better. https://t.co/C8uIUOhMmC",0,1,https://twitter.com/BrandieselKelly/status/1261219124014964737
breath
2020-05-12 15:09:50,"@SingerPamla I hope your daughter feels better. I'm going on 61 days of recovery. The breathing is the hardest, I agree. It's the burning in my chest when I elevate my voice and literally running out of breath just carrying a laundry basket. Wish her well from us. Hang in there, yourself!!",0,1,https://twitter.com/BrandieselKelly/status/1260225680115150848

2020-04-14 11:10:40,"@vid_colin @mjones1968ok @mitchellvii I'm just an active woman from the IL suburbs that tested positive. 2 hospital stays, 14 days quarantined from my family. 3 weeks later, I'm still down. I've had kidney stones, a baby, and a few sports related injuries in my 38 years. I wouldn't wish this shit on anyone. Stay well",0,1,https://twitter.com/BrandieselKelly/status/1250018629841813505
2020-03-27 21:26:46,Reading how people are downplaying Covid-19 is frightening. I'm 38 and active but recently tested positive. This shit is real and scary. Hearing the patients moan on the Covid hospital floor were scary enough. #Stayhomestayhealthysavealife,0,1,https://twitter.com/BrandieselKelly/status/1243650693946388482
