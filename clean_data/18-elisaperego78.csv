test positive
2020-04-15 21:21:01,"@noiranwarorg @BallouxFrancois @racechikee But we have had several ""mild"" cases to still test positive after ~30 days. Not clear if they are still infectious, though.

Touch

You might be already infected w/o knowing it. You might be unlucky &amp; come into contact with the virus on a surface you were not planning to touch,0,0,https://twitter.com/elisaperego78/status/1242285735346147333

Shortness of breath
2020-03-12 23:59:32,"@AmberMaren @campbellsuz @GerHerbert1 The symptoms vary a lot. You might be fully asymptomatic. The most common ones seem to be shortness of breath, dry cough and fever. Cold-like symptoms and sore throat might be sometimes present but not always. Sometimes gastrointestinal symptoms, too. It's really variable.",1,2,https://twitter.com/elisaperego78/status/1238253323494490113
