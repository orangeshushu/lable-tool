cough
2020-05-28 10:50:04,@LincolnsBible I got sick mid-March and my cough lasted on and off for 5 weeks. Do you have a pulse oxometer? If so take your O2 levels frequently. My doc told me if they’re above 93% you’re ok even if you’re hacking up a lung. This thing is brutal. I still get fatigued easily. 😢,0,0,https://twitter.com/soprano58_carol/status/1265958513303568384
2020-04-19 18:32:49,@DavidLat @JCNSeverino Ugh. It seems that this virus is a tenacious little bugger. My ‘relapse’ is milder on the cough end but the fatigue is worse. I hope your cough is short-lived and goes away. My husband has some fatigue and a slight cough but not like when he first got sick. 😢🥺,0,1,https://twitter.com/soprano58_carol/status/1251941842515570688
