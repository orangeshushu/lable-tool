diagnosed with covid
2020-04-29 15:27:36,@pulte $YamiMommy2020 I was just diagnosed with COVID yesterday. What we thought was an upper respiratory/sinus infection turned into be something I hoped to not bring around my premature daughter. Now Iâ€™m worried that sheâ€™s showing signs of having it even with me taking precautionsðŸ˜ž https://t.co/gGsiJdAOgS,0,0,https://twitter.com/yamimccleary1/status/1255519106683584512
covid-19
2020-04-01 19:47:03,Iâ€™m not one to beg but I really could use the help. We are in debt and have been trying to pay it off to get a house before our baby arrives in May. Now Iâ€™m out of work due to Covid-19 and stressing whether we can get out of this bad house we are in. $YamiMommy2020 https://t.co/NETDRyui6W,0,0,https://twitter.com/yamimccleary1/status/1245437541521797120
2020-04-01 19:43:15,@JeffreeStar @haileebabyxox This would help me pay off most of our debt so we can get out of our bad situation and into a house fasterðŸ˜­ Covid-19 has me out of work currently this would mean the world to me and my soon to be new family.,0,0,https://twitter.com/yamimccleary1/status/1245436585405022208
