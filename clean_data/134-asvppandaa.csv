tested positive
2020-03-24 01:46:59,I was tested positive for COVID-19. Luckily I’ve been staying home the past week but this just shows how easy it is to get the virus. Don’t be the person to go out or invite 5 of your friends over to hang when you might not know who is around high risk people. Don’t be selfish.,54,253,https://twitter.com/asvppandaa/status/1242266630907887616
