cold
2020-03-12 17:52:05,"Must be nice to be so able-bodied that you don't even take into consideration that even the common cold can cause severe illness for people with compromised immune systems.

vomiting
2020-02-08 23:25:32,@BeckyHill3 I absolutely agree. It was a traumatic experience where I had spinal fluid leaking from my low back after a violent vomiting episode in a parking lot! Just 10 days after neurosurgery I had to be reopened and have the CSF leak surgically repaired. #StillProcessing #YouAreNotAlone,0,1,https://twitter.com/MindfulDrG/status/1226285966811369473
head pain
2020-01-22 14:38:54,Migraine has taken from me the inability to remember what it is like to live without constant head pain. This impacts every part of my life as my head feels like it is constantly in a fog and in a vice. #ChronicMigraine #MigraineThief https://t.co/850XCvPzBW,2,13,https://twitter.com/MindfulDrG/status/1219992840199118853
medicine
2020-01-11 23:55:20,@BarbyIngle Yes! A basic medicine I have been on for a year is now not covered by my insurance and costs over $150. My doctor called another medicine in for me to replace it. That one isn't covered either. Waiting to hear back from my doctor again. ü§¶üèº‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è,0,4,https://twitter.com/MindfulDrG/status/1216146607391027200
