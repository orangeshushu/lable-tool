fever
2020-03-21 22:00:50,If you are feeling even a little bit funny but don’t have a high enough fever or the right symptoms to get tested- just STAY HOME!!! Monitor yourself. Not only for your health but everyone else’s. I’m 22y/o and this is woopin me. Anyone &amp; everyone is at risk- be smart!!,2,17,https://twitter.com/KelseyPicolo1/status/1241484943810793478
2020-03-21 21:54:44,"I’ve heard people saying some places are only testing if you have above a certain fever, but considering my temp never rose above 99.5F, I can attest that you can still be an active carrier without having a full fever or all the symptoms. It is so important to be aware of this!!!",2,11,https://twitter.com/KelseyPicolo1/status/1241483407382773760
2020-03-21 21:26:05,"My family suggested I come home, so I drove 5 hours to my parents’ house but stopped at a clinic nearby to get a test done. Though I didn’t have a fever anymore, they agreed to do the test since I had been in an extremely high-risk place for the past week and had a few symptoms",0,0,https://twitter.com/KelseyPicolo1/status/1241476195679703043
breath
2020-03-21 21:49:20,"That was yesterday. Today I also feel pretty short of breath so I’m mainly staying in bed. Still extremely tired. Got the call today for my positive results, so I’m glad I have been keeping up with my symptoms day-to-day because I honestly didn’t think it would come back positive",0,2,https://twitter.com/KelseyPicolo1/status/1241482049309020161
2020-03-21 21:44:57,The next day was a whoooole different story. Never felt exhaustion like this. You woulda thought I climbed Mount Everest the day before. I think I only got out of bed to go to the bathroom. Slept all day and felt super short of breath like I couldn’t get enough air in at once,0,0,https://twitter.com/KelseyPicolo1/status/1241480946823712773

2020-03-21 21:42:46,"Next day I had so much energy. I felt a lot better and thought maybe it was the end of all this. Still hadn’t gotten my results back, but I worked out in my room a little bit and cleaned up. However, I did feel a little short of breath. Figured it was from being lazy/sick lately",0,1,https://twitter.com/KelseyPicolo1/status/1241480397164285952
headache
2020-03-21 21:41:32,"The headache wasn’t a normal headache but more like a hangover.

I was also extremely fatigued so I didn’t mind staying in bed",0,2,https://twitter.com/KelseyPicolo1/status/1241480083782742019
2020-03-21 21:39:25,"The day after I had chills, dry cough, and low fever, I still had my dry cough and chills but it was now accompanied by a sore throat and lots of congestion.
