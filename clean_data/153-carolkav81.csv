test positive
2020-05-17 15:15:08,@ClaireByrneLive I'm currently living in a hotel as I'm a HCA who can't work &amp; live at home. Not sure how phase 1 will go but I really do hope it won't bring up the numbers of people who test positive. I want to go home sooner rather than later.,1,12,https://twitter.com/carolkav81/status/1262038953902866433
heart disease
2020-05-17 14:46:00,@dorfarrelly Thank you so much. I was off work for a month as I contracted COVID. Then for me to go back to work I had to find alternative accommodation. I live with my mum who has heart disease so she is in the high risk category. I couldn't risk her health. Yesterday was my 1st day back.,0,1,https://twitter.com/carolkav81/status/1262031622427348992
HIV
2020-05-14 16:32:14,"@oMyAngelShawnO @versdude92 @GeraldFarrakhan @kevi_87 @elegantaphorism Yes that's right. If a person has HIV they have HIV. But it can be undetectable. No one is disputing that if you have HIV, you have HIV.",0,0,https://twitter.com/carolkav81/status/1260971193269653504
2020-05-14 14:40:31,@oMyAngelShawnO @GeraldFarrakhan @kevi_87 @versdude92 @elegantaphorism I'm not trying to convince anyone. If someone says no then no means no.

2020-05-14 09:29:49,"@GeraldFarrakhan @kevi_87 @versdude92 @elegantaphorism Then that's okay. It's no longer a deadly disease. Medication, practising safe sex, being careful, informing people, are all things that you need to do if you are HIV positive. Also don't date someone who is HIV positive. You are potentially missing because of ignorance.",0,0,https://twitter.com/carolkav81/status/1260864886877360128
