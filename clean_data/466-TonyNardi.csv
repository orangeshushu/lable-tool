asthma
2020-04-18 02:02:01,"@Weeknee @PaulCharchian Hey Brian, those “preexisting conditions” include obesity, asthma and htn. Your data as you present it really doesn’t demonstrate anything about how scary this virus is. I can DM you data and walk you through what it means. Or I can put you in contact with colleagues in NYC",0,1,https://twitter.com/TonyNardi/status/1251330110633934849
drug
2020-04-07 18:46:01,"@EdenfieldJd @ChrisMamunes @VirginiaHolbert @IngrahamAngle Hey Duke. Thanks for asking.Most concerning is prolonged QT, significant arrhythmias and death. These are real and not insignificant. I know it seems this drug is just tossed around like candy but it’s fine with clear science and weighing the risks.",1,2,https://twitter.com/TonyNardi/status/1247596510528843776
2020-04-07 18:29:48,"@PodnarSteph @IngrahamAngle Hey Steve, that doesn’t mean it’s “safe”. The drug had lots of side effects. Use of drugs off label (and for known uses)happens but only after careful consideration of risk/benefit. It’s not for. President or Laura to be endorsing and hyping.",0,2,https://twitter.com/TonyNardi/status/1247592426040107013
2020-04-02 23:29:08,"@Mary_Jai1 @GrecianFormula @IngrahamAngle Hey Mary, at the doses being suggested for COVID it can quickly become toxic. That leads to potential severe cardiac issue no matter how short the duration. This drug may work. It may not. It’s a decision left to medicine. Not the president or Laura Ingraham. Or you to promote.",0,1,https://twitter.com/TonyNardi/status/1245855818940944384
2020-04-02 23:25:52,"@AngryMawg @Visigoth5157 @IngrahamAngle Hey Mawg, what makes this GOP vs Dems? Science is science. It’s a complicated drug being touted for an unknown disease. GOP or not, let the doctors decide with ind. pts. Our Baffoon president and Ms Ingraham have no role.",0,0,https://twitter.com/TonyNardi/status/1245854994223357954
2020-04-02 19:12:45,Point missed. This drug has deadly side effects which are worsened at these dosages and there is unproven benefit. The criticism is that the “Dolt in Chief” had no business hyping them as “cures”. We have limited “treatments”. So we try anything after weighing the risks. https://t.co/RsnmbgUKq3,0,0,https://twitter.com/TonyNardi/status/1245791296943513600

2020-04-04 14:01:08,"@0x445442 @BSkip22 @ScottAdamsSays .....that this is a “mild flu” are patently wrong. It demonstrates a lack of understanding of medicine and epidemiology. No doubt, this is crippling the economy. But here is another website to check out:
