covid-19
2020-05-12 17:57:41,@JeffreeStar I actually ended up getting COVID-19 and spent my entire last paycheck on medication and co-pays. Testing was not free for me or my son. And now I’m behind on bills. Anything would help 🙏🏻   $JenSophia20 #JeffreeStarApproved,0,0,https://twitter.com/JenSophiaW/status/1260267918698389505
