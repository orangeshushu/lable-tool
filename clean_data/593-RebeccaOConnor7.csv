2020-04-28 16:35:31,@LisaMillerrrrr 100% agree with you! I told the lady this over the phone. I tried going to work yesterday as they take my temperature everyday before i enter and i don't have a cough at all. I thought i was OK on these grounds. The other symptoms need to be publicised!

headaches
2020-04-28 16:56:19,@MikesTri2016 @LisaMillerrrrr Thanks Mike! I would say I've been getting headaches for about 5 days now. I never get headaches so i knew something was wrong. For me the headaches were my strongest symptom! Can you get tested? It is probably worth doing!,0,0,https://twitter.com/RebeccaOConnor7/status/1255179047874723841
