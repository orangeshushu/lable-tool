2020-04-26 09:30:53,@newsjunkyjimmy @AZCorrections Naeva has a LOT of questions: “Ask him why have other states made the executive decisions to release a number of inmates to combat covid-19 but Arizona is stating it will not release.”,0,0,https://twitter.com/Sygourney/status/1254342176072499201
2020-04-26 07:18:41,Maybe they should have taken this COVID-19 a bit more seriously? Are they wearing PPE?

2020-04-25 19:56:06,@newsjunkyjimmy Ask him what Florence is doing differently from the rest of AZDOC because 28 inmates are sick there and no other prison has such high numbers.
