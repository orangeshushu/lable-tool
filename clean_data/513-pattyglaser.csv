cough
2020-04-01 18:34:33,"#COVID19 7/8 I take frequent naps &amp; spent a few days sleeping. My goal was to stay out of hospital. This is day 14 &amp; still coughing, 1 nap/day. From 4-6am is brutal b/c I need inhalers. I then cough for about 30 min. &amp; fall back asleep for a bit. The rest of my day is better now.",0,3,https://twitter.com/pattyglaser/status/1245419295364046851
2020-04-01 18:34:32,"#COVID19 2/8 Even though I was fairly certain of results, hearing it is jarring. Here is my story. I had a bit of an allergy-like cough 3/16 &amp; 17 - nothing alarming &amp; at that time my car was covered in fresh pollen. I also had a constant dull headache which I don’t usually get.",0,3,https://twitter.com/pattyglaser/status/1245419289391386624
albuterol
2020-04-01 18:34:33,#COVID19 6/8 My husband suggested constant cool humidifier &amp; that helped. Vick’s vaporub on chest in morning &amp; evening was soothing &amp; helped suppress the cough. By 3/20 my doc added a nebulizer with albuterol (my coughing was worse &amp; I had some mild chest pains) and a z-pack.,0,3,https://twitter.com/pattyglaser/status/1245419293585612809
inhaler
2020-04-01 18:34:32,#COVID19 5/8 My doc helped keep me calm &amp; focused on solutions. I take a Dulera inhaler whenever I have allergy issues which I started at 1st sign of a cough. Also take singular daily. Doc added mucinex night &amp; day &amp; a “rescue” inhaler of ventolin.,0,3,https://twitter.com/pattyglaser/status/1245419292235096066
