painful
2020-04-16 17:03:18,@ladypen13 It's a shame the information has to come via fuckwits tbh. They don't seem to stream the information directly. It's painful,0,0,https://twitter.com/imovecars/status/1250832150561161216
2020-04-16 16:45:49,@ladypen13 I'd be more surprised if there was anyone on Sky News worth watching. BBC the same. ITV the same. There is no decent news coverage in this country. It's painful,0,3,https://twitter.com/imovecars/status/1250827750497230849
drug
2020-04-15 06:31:57,@messalinahooper @Connor_St02 Unfortunately the money tree hasn't sprouted this year. Simplifying NHS services is the only answer. I'd also suggest no treatment for smokers (like myself) who don't give up nor for drug addicts past one or two rounds of rehab.,0,0,https://twitter.com/imovecars/status/1250310879570092032
cold
2020-04-14 10:02:07,@Jenn7_4 It is a Corona virus. But it's not Covid 19. I had a positive test for Covid 19 and all I had were cold symptoms. Not even that bad a cold tbh,0,0,https://twitter.com/imovecars/status/1250001377969016835

tested positive
2020-04-09 09:16:15,"@tesssummers98 @thetopcattony The death figures are a loaf of shit anyway. Trauma deaths are included if the patient has tested positive for ANY Corona virus (not just COVID 19) 

They should only be quoting figures where Covid 19 was actually responsible for the death",0,1,https://twitter.com/imovecars/status/1248177898554613761
