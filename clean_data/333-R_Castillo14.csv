covid-19
2020-04-30 16:23:12,Im hoping that I’m in the last stages of covid-19 along with my parents. We’re doing so well. They had been sick like two weeks ago and we’re doing good rn.

fever
2020-04-29 19:32:28,"@BellusRuinae Thanks. I went to the free drive up ones so no, other than getting your own fever reducer. They said most are treatable at home unless your basically dying then go to the ER. It should be out in 10-14days but other than that drink lots of fluids/stay hydrated and green tea helps",0,0,https://twitter.com/R_Castillo14/status/1255580730127781891
