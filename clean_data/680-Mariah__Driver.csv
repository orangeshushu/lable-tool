covid-19
2020-05-26 18:16:51,My very talented partner wrote a very good thing about mental health in America during COVID-19 üëáüèæ https://t.co/AzpF14JwTi,0,4,https://twitter.com/Mariah__Driver/status/1265346172652142593
fever
2020-04-21 16:06:32,"Last week, my cough, congestion, and fever worsened. My partner started to experience chest pain, and luckily I was able to talk to a doctor and get a test within 24 hours. 

TLDR; retrospect. Listen to your bodies ‚Äî¬†even when they're whispering. It can save lives.

2020-04-21 16:04:16,"One day, I was surprised to see a temp of 99.6. I didn‚Äôt feel sick, but continued taking it throughout the week. The next day, it was at 99.7, then 99.8, and held steady at 99.9 since then. Low enough to not cause concern, but in retrospect: a fever nonetheless. /10",0,9,https://twitter.com/Mariah__Driver/status/1252629234138284033
sore throat
2020-04-21 16:05:00,"My fifth and final symptom before I got tested: A sore throat and cough. It started as an HOURLY cough. Not exaggerating. I was consistently coughing only once or twice an hour. No chest pain. No coughing fits. But a consistent, sporadic cough.  /11",0,7,https://twitter.com/Mariah__Driver/status/1252629415638347776
low fever
2020-04-21 16:04:06,"My fourth mild(ish) symptom: a low fever. I have always proudly been, a 98.6er. Right on the dot. 

And since COVID started, I‚Äôve been taking my temperature at least once a day. Again, most days, 98.6. Very nice. *Cue Borat  /9",0,6,https://twitter.com/Mariah__Driver/status/1252629190190313473
breath
2020-04-21 16:03:31,"My second mild symptom: breathlessness. I'm a talker. Like great-candidate-for-those-unrealistic-TV-monologues talker. 

Last week, I continued to be a talker but caught myself running out of breath at the end of sentences. Weird right? Well, not corona-weird, or so I thought. /7",0,10,https://twitter.com/Mariah__Driver/status/1252629042987057152
taste
2020-04-21 16:01:24,"When they say that the symptoms can be ‚Äúmild‚Äù they mean MILD. Like mild canned salsa that legit just taste like plain tomato juice with a slice of onion and one cilantro leaf mild.

tested positive
2020-04-21 16:00:34,"Tested positive for COVID-19. Before my symptoms worsened this weekend, they were so mild they were almost undetectable. 

I worry that many others are experiencing the same, and carrying the virus without realizing it. Sharing a few things I wish I looked for

Anyone looking for a copywriter or editor to work with them on a contract basis?
