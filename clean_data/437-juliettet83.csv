fever
2020-05-18 14:32:43,In my covid isolation boredom I have worked out that in the last 37 days I have had a fever at least once a day for 27 of them... Question is does that now make me hot?! 😂😂#Covid_19 #hot #COVID19,0,4,https://twitter.com/juliettet83/status/1262390666165960704
2020-04-23 15:58:15,@LtotheJtotheP @jonathanshalit 😂😂 I've learnt the skills of sleeping for 16-18 hours of the day and coping with a fever for 12 days straight! Does that count?,0,1,https://twitter.com/juliettet83/status/1253352494488567812
2020-04-19 08:29:07,Day 8 of covid and I think I've run out of new symptoms to try out! Fingers crossed the 3pm fever doesn't arrive today and I can feel like I'm making progress. Oh and if someone has found all my energy could you drop it back?! #covidtired #coronavirus #COVID19,0,2,https://twitter.com/juliettet83/status/1251789916079566848
2020-04-14 17:39:40,Day 3 of suspected covid- started the day with fever and rigors and its not got much better! Husband confirmed positive covid so just waiting for my result to confirm the same.

covid-19
2020-04-20 12:46:41,Finally got the result of my Covid-19 test... POSITIVE! What a surprise considering I've had every symptom there was but thankfully not had serious symptoms that required hospital treatment. I count myself very lucky for that ❤️,0,1,https://twitter.com/juliettet83/status/1252217120584318976
mild fever
2020-04-19 10:31:46,@LtotheJtotheP This is the truth. I think I've had a new symptom every single day. Day 8 and still getting mild fevers. And I'll feel better for a couple of hours and then BAM here's another symptom! Hope you are getting better xx,0,1,https://twitter.com/juliettet83/status/1251820782608617473
