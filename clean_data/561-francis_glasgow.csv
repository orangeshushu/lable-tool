2020-04-14 15:24:52,Celtic fans should be relaxed about how Dundee vote.9 in a row will happen regardless.Let Sevco cut their nose off to spite their face and just be patient ten will be worse for them and 11 will just be part of their reality.,10,74,https://twitter.com/francis_glasgow/status/1250082602008150016

2020-01-14 21:03:12,@P__67 No I'm saying they're totally different types but Griffiths should be given time to recover as pressure from his own fans is the last thing he needs.Depression is a killer and he's fought it in the spotlight,0,1,https://twitter.com/francis_glasgow/status/1217190450521616386
