drug
2020-05-19 01:00:26,"@emmytargaryen @BattinsonBatman I respect that too. 

I don’t know why DC fans want an alcoholic. A  drug user in Ezra cause let’s be honest, he had to be on something to hit that fan, and a woman in the middle of a domestic abuse scandal.

The Dothraki were super chill after their Queen was dead. I was hoping Grey Warm would slit Tyrion’s throat when he was talking but he didn’t. 

The show ended in season 6 in my opinion",0,3,https://twitter.com/Khaleesi_Hodan/status/1260300085277143042
