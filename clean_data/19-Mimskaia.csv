2020-04-08 12:34:27,@Ldn_Ambulance I called 111 and they insisted I phoned 999. I wasn’t that poorly but had renewed chest pain symptoms after 2 weeks of illness. The official line of mild covid-19 lasting only 7 days makes it confusing and scary for people with persisting symptoms. 1/2,0,0,https://twitter.com/Mimskaia/status/1247865390614659073

2020-03-23 15:33:40,@drsanjaygupta This is how it started for me late on Saturday with mild DI symptoms (mild nausea&amp;slight stomach upset). No diarrhoea or vomiting though. The next day I woke up with a low grade fever &amp;pressure on upper chest on and off.

Comfortable or not with it it is my body. I wish I had the strength of a man and could be spared period pains and the menopause.
