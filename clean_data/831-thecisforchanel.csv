taste
2020-04-04 15:11:35,"I was frantically on Twitter before/after I got tested trying to figure out how long loss of taste would last so I hope this helps someone. Iâ€™ve read it can last much longer but hang in there! for everyone else: wash your hands, donâ€™t touch your face, &amp; donâ€™t congregate!",0,18,https://twitter.com/thecisforchanel/status/1246455382643482626
2020-04-04 15:10:02,"it started with what felt like a cold: congested sinuses, heavy fatigue, minimal cough, no fever. I took Day/NyQuil for about 3 days and felt good as new! but then I lost my sense of smell + taste for 6 full days with no other symptoms. I barely ate then b/c loss of appetite",0,22,https://twitter.com/thecisforchanel/status/1246454989146460161
