2020-04-15 10:24:15,8 days after a positive Covid test result I am back in work! It has been good to keep in touch with what has been going on by email.  It has been even better to come back and find the team have been doing a stirling job without me! I am so proud of all they are doing right now.,2,133,https://twitter.com/MattCooperSAS/status/1250369337023696896

Less professional barriers and more system thinking can make a real difference if done properly and safely. Itâ€™s like the old AED argument played out again. Everyone has some role to play in preventing drug deaths.,3,17,https://twitter.com/MattCooperSAS/status/1231203846581608449
