ache
2020-04-15 23:01:26,@BreeSpe91482576 I am a HUGE proponent of ‚Äútragedy is personal‚Äù so I try not to fall in the trap of comparing pain other people have. Broken ankles are awful (I‚Äôve had one); the sharp pain + dull ache + being incapacitated is so tough!

breathing problems
2020-04-12 15:18:00,"Hospital for breathing problems. A swab was negative for active #COVID19 . Blood test showed huge inflammation.

tested positive
