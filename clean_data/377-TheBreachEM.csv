Day 8
Worsening cough, quite hacking now. Pain in chest due to coughing. Chest tight but monitoring sats. Will go in to hospital if they drop &lt;95%. Staying in isolation.

1. Use Ottawa rule to exclude SAH

2. A negative CT within 6hr rules out SAH

Thank you.

Day 2
Had another episode of 'fever', but no temperature. Felt very cold, with muscle aches and headache. At this point I decided I was probably brewing COVID, despite still having no temperature and no cough. I just felt too unwell for it to be a simple cold.",0,12,https://twitter.com/TheBreachEM/status/1244145555053436928

It's particularly interesting to me that I have had no cough (until recently) and no fever (apart from a single raised temperature). COVID can manifest in a variety of ways, so be alert to any change in normal.

Anyway, this has been my week...",0,16,https://twitter.com/TheBreachEM/status/1244145552666824704

I've just tested positive for COVID-19.

I'm an ED registrar in London who has treated many patients with COVID. I'm learning that it can present in a variety of ways.

I thought it would be useful to post about my symptoms so far, in the interests of better understanding.",84,205,https://twitter.com/TheBreachEM/status/1244145550938771456

The 'Warburg effect': cancer cells seem to preferentially metabolise via anaerobic glycolysis.

Here's a good review paper on the topic..
