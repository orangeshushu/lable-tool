my nose
2020-05-07 14:28:11,I’m off for Covid test #4 today. I think I’m starting to revert to being a child because after every test I’m like “what else can I shove up my nose?” 🤣🤣🤣jk,0,6,https://twitter.com/kristruelove5/status/1258403256520318976
tested positive
2020-05-01 17:18:42,"I got my results of my second test. I tested positive. The first negative was a false negative. That’s why they wanted me to take two tests.

recover
2020-04-26 21:40:49,Most of you may know that me and my family are still trying to recover from Covid. Please tell me why my brother in law’s fiancé just sent us a text tell us what we can get them for Christmas. Not “hey how are y’all feeling” or “how’s it going”. Just a pic of what they want. 🤦‍♀️🖕,0,7,https://twitter.com/kristruelove5/status/1254525868057268224

bad cough
2020-02-18 05:47:44,"@MrsP123 Depends on your symptoms. If you have a bad cough, then something like mucinex to break up the congestion in your chest. If you don’t have a bad cough, then I always take alka-seltzer cold. Zinc always helps me out too, it seems to help me kick it faster.",0,1,https://twitter.com/kristruelove5/status/1229643642895290368
