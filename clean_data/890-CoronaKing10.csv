2020-03-31 20:56:02,Day 3 of infection - keep staring at photos of my friends who I want to French kiss. My ass is sore from constantly wiping with toilet paper. I haven’t been shitting but I’ve got 1500 rolls to get through. Going to order uber eats and touch the delivery driver. #coronavirus,0,0,https://twitter.com/CoronaKing10/status/1245092514287120385
