recover
2020-05-06 09:05:50,@corienb @Tobalilla @PaulGarnerWoof @OpenMedF @JanetDafoe @DrMaureenHanson @davidtuller1 @Dr_M_Guthridge I truly understand (my niece has ME). I had a CT scan yesterday and there is still inflammation. So for now I am hoping for lung recovery. I think it's important that all covid patients get the time to try to fully recover and not rush that in 2 weeks.,0,0,https://twitter.com/BvlCharlotte/status/1257959747912904706
dry cough

I still have lung issues, burning upper back pain, dry cough, elevated temperature, feeling of 'an elephant on my chest'. It seems to be cyclical.",0,6,https://twitter.com/BvlCharlotte/status/1257825619724963841
