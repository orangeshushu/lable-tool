pain
2020-04-07 19:34:27,2 years ago today my dad went into the hospital with stomach pain &amp; was informed that same night that it looked like he had cancer.. Today he’s happily in remission &amp; “perfect as always”. Thankful he’s healthy especially during a time like this💚 https://t.co/vVibMtZmhb,0,67,https://twitter.com/AmbsScherer/status/1247608697825755136
