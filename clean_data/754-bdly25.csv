smell
2020-05-13 15:14:16,"@Mr_Ree_ Taste back to normal and no longer craving cheese 😂. Sense of smell has been all over the place though, came back but gone again now. Finally feel myself though after a whole month. Hope you’re doing alright as well! Take care",0,0,https://twitter.com/bdly25/status/1260589184571584512
2020-04-22 20:57:10,@Mr_Ree_ How long were you without taste for? Just trying to work out when my sense of smell might come back 😂. I’ve not really lost my taste thankfully. Definitely not as good as it used to be but think that’s just because my smells gone.,0,0,https://twitter.com/bdly25/status/1253065329502236672

fever
2020-04-11 16:52:31,Honestly I’m in shock lol. The media and government spouting that ‘if you have a cough or a fever stay home’. I had *the* mildest cough and decided to stay at home as a precaution. My major symptom was fatigue and a really achey back and neck. Stay safe everyone. #covid19,0,0,https://twitter.com/bdly25/status/1249017497594011648
