My step son became addicted to <span style="color: yellow;"><span style="color: yellow;">pain</span></span> meds at 13 yrs old b4 we even knew what happened. He's been clean for 7 yrs. We didn't realize till he was 17. Got him help &amp; r very glad that the problem never turned into a heroin addiction like many ppl we knew.</td>

I was just replying to ur tweet that said he had <span style="color: yellow;"><span style="color: yellow;">pain</span></span> pills all season &amp; you were wondering if he had mixed those with alcohol. Hope his back problems serious! 
Either way, we should pray for him &amp; Amen, he's a horrible drunk!!!</td>
