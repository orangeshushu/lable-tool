I've been to five BTS concerts, 2 arenas fairly close up &amp; 3 stadiums (2 days Rose Bowl &amp; 1 day CitiField in NYC). At CitiField we had total <span style="color: yellow;"><span style="color: yellow;">nosebleed</span></span> seats up on a side &amp; it was the BEST and most intimate of all - for me. I cried with joy.</td>
