1. HEALED OF CORONA VIRUS 
Sister Amanda Eze (from Ireland)

I fell sick on the 21st of March 2020. I was sick and had terrible <span style="color: yellow;"><span style="color: yellow;">headache</span></span> which lasted for over a week. Not knowing what was wrong, I went for the COVID-19 test and it was positive.
