                <td class ="content_left">@akeirans @CrimsonGash @SRuhle I am speaking from personal experience when I say that the symptoms of the COVID19 virus can be mild. I'm waiting on test results but I have the same symptoms as someone that I know that tested positive. We can't smell or taste anything. That's it. No <span style="color: yellow;"><span style="color: yellow;">respiratory symptoms</span></span> at all.</td>

                <td class ="content_left">@Science4Bernie @_FoggyDew I can't afford my deductible so I can't see a doctor for my leg quite yet. I probably shouldn't be walking around on it but I can't afford to miss work. Looks like I'm free to choose continued <span style="color: yellow;"><span style="color: yellow;">pain</span></span> and probable damage to my leg. Ain't freedom grand!</td>
