Most people have <span style="color: yellow;"><span style="color: yellow;">no symptoms</span></span> or mild ones when infected with COVID-19 and that includes me. But some people do suffer a lot so this shouldn't come as a surprise.

Get well soon.</td>

SARS was more deadly than COVID-19 in terms of symptoms. COVID-19 is more transmissible but 80% of all people who contract COVID-19 experience <span style="color: yellow;"><span style="color: yellow;">no symptoms</span></span> at all, if not mild ones.</td>
